 these insects have negative ecological and economic impacts since they lower crop yield , and pesticides are expensive and can have off - target effects on beneficial arthropods
 . a better understanding of lepidopteran immunity will aid in identifying new targets for the development of specific insect pest management compounds .
 a fundamental aspect of immunity , and therefore a logical target for control , is the induction of antimicrobial peptide ( amp ) expression .

 we highlight how such comparative immunology could aid in developing pest management strategies that are specific to agricultural insect pests .

 pathways leading to amp expression have been extensively studied in the dipteran drosophila melanogaster . however , diptera are an important group of pollinators and pest management strategies that target their immune systems is not recommended .
 recent advances have facilitated investigation of lepidopteran immunity , revealing both conserved and derived characteristics .

Question: very specific question

 Can you explain the role of the glomus jugulare tumor  and how does it relate to the patient's symptoms?
