 there is also wide variation in technique , not only in placement of the roux limb , but also regarding closure or nonclosure of the mesenteric defects . 
 the objective of this study was to examine the incidence and characteristics of sbo after antecolic antegastric bypass with nonclosure of the mesenteric defect of the jejunojejunal anastomosis.methods:this is a retrospective review of a series of consecutive lgbs over a 3-year period . 
 all procedures were performed by the same surgeon using the same technique . in no case was the mesenteric defect closed . a prospectively maintained database 
 was used for data collection . 
 patients who returned with an sbo were the study group , and those who underwent revisional bariatric surgery or conversion to open operation were excluded.results:there were 249 primary lgbs performed during the study period ; 15 of the operations were followed by sbo , for an incidence of 6.0% . 
 four cases were caused by an internal hernia ( ih ) , for an incidence of 1.6% , and 11 were caused by adhesions , which accounted for 73% of the sbos.conclusions:sbo after lgb is a relatively common complication . 
 the incidence of sbo from ih with nonclosure of the mesenteric defect is similar to that in other series where the defect is closed . 
 regardless of the cause of the sbo , operative treatment of the patient who has a gastric bypass remains the definitive standard and should not be delayed .

 inheritance of the apoe4 allele is the strongest genetic risk factor for late - onset ad .

 it has been hypothesized that apoe and apoe4 in particular is an amyloid catalyst or  
 pathological chaperone  . 
 alternatively it has been posited that apoe regulates a clearance , with apoe4 been worse at this function compared to apoe3 . 
 these views seem fundamentally opposed . 
 the former would indicate that removing apoe will reduce ad pathology , while the latter suggests increasing brain apoe levels may be beneficial . 
 here we consider the scientific basis of these different models of apoe function and suggest that these seemingly opposing views can be reconciled . the optimal therapeutic target may be to inhibit the interaction of apoe with a rather than altering apoe levels . 
 such an approach will not have detrimental effects on the many beneficial roles apoe plays in neurobiology . 
 furthermore , other a binding proteins , including act and apo j can inhibit or promote a oligomerization / polymerization depending on conditions and might be manipulated to effect ad treatment .

 those who were exposed to fungicides and insecticides also had higher total pesticide exposure . 
 furthermore , a farmer who was a pesticide applicator , mixer , loader , and who had not been given instructions through training was at risk of having higher pesticide exposure . 
 the most prevalent symptoms were headache ( 64.1% ) , muscle pain ( 61.1% ) , cough ( 45.5% ) , weakness ( 42.4% ) , eye pain ( 39.9% ) , chest pain ( 37.4% ) , and eye redness ( 33.8% ) . 
 the data can be used for the formulation of an integrated program on safety and health in the vegetable industry .

 we investigated the association of the enpp1 k121q polymorphism with both diabetes and obesity ( body mass index [ bmi ] ) in korean male workers . 
 the study design was case - control . 
 subjects were 1,945 male workers ( type 2 diabetes , 195 ; non - diabetes , 1,750 ) of nuclear power plants who received examinations from march to october in 2004 . 
 we collected venous blood samples under fasting ( 8 hr ) conditions , calculated bmi by height and weight , and assessed relevant biochemical factors . 
 the results of this study demonstrated that the enpp1 121q genotype ( kq+qq types ) was not associated with type 2 diabetes ( odds ratios [ or ] , 0.854 ; 95% confidence interval [ ci ] , 0.571 - 1.278 ) or obesity ( or , 0.933 ; 95% ci , 0.731 - 1.190 ) . 
 in addition , the frequency of the q allele was not related to type 2 diabetes ( or , 0.911 ; 95% ci , 0.630 - 1.319 ) or obesity ( or , 0.962 ; 95% ci , 0.767 - 1.205 ) . 
 we concluded that the enpp1 121q allele is not a critical determinant for either diabetes or obesity in korean males . 
 the discordance between the results of this study and those derived from studies of dominican , south asian , caucasian , finnish , and french populations might be due to differences in genetic backgrounds between these populations .

2023-10-31 08:28:29.720 | INFO     | __main__:<cell line: 14>:19 - Text: we compared serum polychlorinated dibenzo - p - dioxins ( pcdds ) and polychlorinated dibenzofurans ( pcdfs ) among residents of two homes to levels among age- and sex - matched comparison subjects . 
 the residents of the two homes consumed contaminated eggs and beef from animals raised at the homes . 
 the animals had greater soil contact than those raised with conventional commercial husbandry practices . 
 the comparison subjects were from a similar rural area , but did not consume home - produced beef and eggs . 
 serum levels of 2,3,7 , 8-substituted tetra- , penta- , and hexacdds and penta- , hexa- , and heptacdfs were increased between 2- and 6-fold in residents from one home ; contaminated eggs and beef were consumed by residents for 2 - 15 years . 
 elevations were less for those in the other index home , where only home - produced eggs were consumed for 2 years ; a 3-fold elevation of 1,2,3,7,8,9-hexacdd as compared to controls was most apparent . 
 very strong bivariate correlations among all of the 2,3,7 , 8 penta- and hexacdds / cdfs were observed . 
 the elevations observed verify that pcdd / pcdf - contaminated food contributed to the body burden of these compounds . 
 the blood levels among the highest exposed participants are generally higher than those observed in other studies of u.s . 
 contaminated - fish consumers and higher than average adipose tissue levels observed in u.s . urban populations . 
 there are sufficient animal toxicologic and human epidemiologic data to recommend that exposures be reduced . in the study area , 
 pentachlorophenol and pentachlorophenol incineration sources have been identified , and the animal contamination and blood elevations probably reflect these sources . 
 soil reference values and site - specific risk assessments should include estimates of exposures to contamination in home - produced animal products . 
 such estimates can be verified with limited pcdd / pcdf sampling of animals and humans.imagesfigure 1figure 2
